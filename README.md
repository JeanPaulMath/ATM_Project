# ATM-Project
/******************************************************************************************************************  
* August: 
* By the end of August I plan on having a completed outline of the necessary classes, attributes, objects, and 
* operations needed to create the ATM program.
*  
*
* September 1-15:
* During the first half of September, I hope to have the program control classes (ATM, screen, keypad, etc.) fully implemented and 
* functioning properly.
* September 16-30:
* During the  second half of the month I also plan on having the user operations classes completed (deposit, withdrawl, balance,etc.)
*
* October 1-15:
* By October the overall ATM program should be completed with no major issues or at least minor fixes that can be remedied quickly. 
* October will primarily be dedicated to creating the GUI that will be used for the program.
* October 16-31:
* By the end of October the GUI should work and the rest of the month should be spent trying to enhance the GUI for the user's 
* experience (Design, Visibility, Accessibility).
*
* November 1-15:
* By the this point, the program should be complete and this time will be dedicated towards debugging or cleaning up uneccessary/ 
* overly complicated code that can be simplified (Will be doing throughout the project but this time is dedicated to debugging).
* November 16-30:
* The final part of this project will be dedicated to making sure the project's code is written according to style expectations.
* Project documentation will also be completed and include appropriate comments and diagrams (Style and documentation will be done
* throughout the project).
*
* December:
* project is completed and submitted.
